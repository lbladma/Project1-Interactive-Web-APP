## Project Requirements

As a group we were required to use everything we’ve learnt over the past six units to create a real-world front-end application that we’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The project must fulfil the following requirements:
```
✔️ Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
✔️ Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
✔️ Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
✔️ Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).
✔️ Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
✔️ Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
✔️ Be responsive.
✔️ Have a polished UI.
✔️ Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
✔️ Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```

## Presentation Requirements
```
🎤 **Elevator pitch**: a one minute description of your application
📖 **Concept**: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
♻️ **Process**: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
💻 **Demo**: Show your stuff!
⏭️ Directions for **Future Development**
🔗 **Links** to the deployed application and the GitHub repository
```
